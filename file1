    git stash list::-
                         List the stash entries that you currently have. Each stash entry is listed with its name (e.g. stash@{0} is 
                         the latest entry, stash@{1} is the one before, etc.), the name of the branch that was current when the 
                         entry was made, and a short description of the commit the entry was based on.
