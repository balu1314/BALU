GIT MERGE / REBASE:
It's simple, with rebase you say to use another branch as the new base for your work.
If you have for example a branch master and you create a branch to implement a new 
feature, say you name it cool-feature, of course the master branch is the base for your new 
feature.
Now at a certain point you want to add the new feature you implemented in 
the master branch. You could just switch to master and merge the cool-feature branch
